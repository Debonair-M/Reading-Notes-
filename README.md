-  Growth Mindset- The ability to step out of one's comfort zone when faced against learning something new. 

-  In order to stay in Growth Mindset I personally

1.  Keep an open mind- In order to truly grasp something new or unfamilar you must be willing to give an effort.

2.  Two Come Prepared- Being Prepared to learn is a huge factor of growth mindset because, dis-organization can be a distraction.

3.  Trying My Best No Matter What- Simply having a positive outlook can boost one's enthusiam to learn as much as they can.
