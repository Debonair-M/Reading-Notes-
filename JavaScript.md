# JavaScript Notes
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.
JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

* Example- 
<html>
<head>
  <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
 
First name: <input id="first_name">
Last name: <input id="last_name">
<button id="say">Say hi!</button>

There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:
Using var
Using let
Using const

*JS Identifers-
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

* JS Data Types-
JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".
In programming, text values are called text strings.
JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.
Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.

You declare a JavaScript variable with the var keyword
Since JavaScript treats underscore as a letter, identifiers containing _ are valid variable names
